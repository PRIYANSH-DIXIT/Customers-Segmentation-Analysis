# Mall Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project analyzes mall customer data using clustering techniques to uncover customer segments and provide actionable business insights. The notebook demonstrates:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes and summarizes customer demographics and spending behavior.
- **Clustering Algorithms:**
  - **K-Means Clustering**
  - **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**
  - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Silhouette Score
  - Davies-Bouldin Index
  - Elbow Method
- **3D Visualization:** Interactive plots to visualize clusters in three dimensions (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score).

## Files
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Dataset containing customer information.
- `customer-segmentation-k-means-dbscan-hierarchical (1).ipynb`: Main analysis notebook.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Review the visualizations and clustering results.
